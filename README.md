ABAQUS_Mechanic_Fracture
The main goal of this research is based on mechanic fracture, which is related to the crack propagation in the material. In this thesis, there are both numerical and analysis solutions for J integral on the rectangular sheet in mixed modes (with and without crack orientation angle) of fracture. Rectangular sheet 200 by 60 mm is modeled in 3 dimensions, having central crack under tensor loading. The thickness of the crack is 1.6 with a length of 12 mm. The purpose is to predict the growth of a crack and obtain the stress, strain and displacement distributions. In this research, the mentioned distributions were extracted as outputs from Abaqus software and also compared with analytical solutions in MATLAB software in order to verify the accuracy of crack growth ad its propagation prediction.
